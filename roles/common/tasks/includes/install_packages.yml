# This is a reusable task for installing packages
# Usage examples:
# When package name matches role name:
# - name: Install rofi
#   include_tasks: ../../common/tasks/includes/install_packages.yml
#   vars:
#     role_name: rofi
#
# When package name differs from role name:
# - name: Install Golang
#   include_tasks: ../../common/tasks/includes/install_packages.yml
#   vars:
#     package_name: "golang-1.20"
#     role_name: golang
#
# Multiple packages:
# - name: Install i3 and related packages
#   include_tasks: ../../common/tasks/includes/install_packages.yml
#   vars:
#     package_names:
#       - i3
#       - i3blocks
#       - i3lock
#     role_name: i3

- name: Install {{ role_name | default('package') }}
